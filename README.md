The Schreier-Sims algorithm
Decompose how a combinatorial group can be generated as a subset of a permutation group.
Blurb from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schreier%E2%80%93Sims_algorithm):
> Once performed, it allows a linear time computation of
> - the order of a finite permutation group,
> - group membership test (is a given permutation contained in a group?),
> - and many other tasks.
